* TOOD

tood is a simple curses application for managing a todo list.  This is alpha
quality software and I may never need it to be anything more.

The program needs to run on my phone.  The easiest way to do this is Python
under Termux.

The list is backed on version control (git) and all operations trigger a
commit, so data loss is unlikely.
